      <h3>The clockwork laws of cause and effect.</h3>
      <p>
        In the first 10-20 years of our lives, the persona we take up is largely
        caused by circumstances that are not within our control.

        <li>
          The beliefs and values of our parents are adopted by us as we depend on our parents for survival.
        </li>
        <li>
          The choice of school that we are enrolled in is largely dependent on
          our family's financial circumstances.
        </li>
        <li>
          The physical appearance you are endowed with has contributed to some
          of your early accomplishments or a lack thereof.

          The above points made are part of a debate on determinism and
          free-will.

        Most importantly, most of us require some sort of catalyst that opens up
        our minds to new possibilities. And NotOverthinking could just be that
        catalyst.

        Being aware of a different life script can allow u to play a different

      <p>What we are able to conceive is largely limited by our knowledge.</p>

        For example, the idea of living your life free from a 9 am-5 pm job
        could seem unattainable for those who are unaware of the non-traditional

        To give another example, I first came across the idea of hiring personal
        assistants whose job is to manage both the professional and personal
        aspects of your life in

        . Prior to reading the book, it just seems ludicrous that someone would
        pay a personal assistant to help send a "happy birthday" text to their
        loved ones in pursuit of greater productivity.

      <h3>“Thinking outside the box” vs “Expanding the box”</h3>
      <p>
        We are often told to be creative and think outside the box. Surely there
        are ways to trigger our creative thinking.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the discovery of a creative solution is often ascribed to new
        insights. By putting more on your plate,

        Those who do not understand might even enviously claim that your
        successes are a result of luck.

      <h3>Actionable</h3>
      <p>Consistently expand your "box".</p>

        Without which, groundbreaking opportunities are much harder to come by.

        Just as how
        <a href="https://www.notoverthinking.com/"> NotOverthinking</a> has
        served as my catalyst. I hope that this blog post has convinced you to
        relentlessly seek to expand the box in which our minds are trapped
        within. This is only the beginning of a life-long journey to learn and
        create.
